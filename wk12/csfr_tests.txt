Changing a form action destination can help secure the application, as I can see. However, we need to protect both pages, the one with form 
and the one that processes it.

Using session is one of the ways to mitigate attacks, because it requires both pages to access the same value
and compare. It makes it harder to guess the credentials but it is still possible to hijack the session or
tamper the values in hidden fields.  

So, using csfr_form.php is a little better than no validation at all, but it is still susceptible to attacks.
